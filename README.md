Code for illustrations in Dale (submitted) introducing complex dynamical systems

# logistic.R

A commonly used model to illustrate core concepts of complexity and dynamics. Code runs individual simulations of the logistic map and reconstructs its values ($x_t$) across a range of its parameter (r).
